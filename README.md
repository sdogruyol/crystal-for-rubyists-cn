# 知道 Ruby 吗? 进入 Crystal 吧！

[Crystal](http://crystal-lang.org/) 编程语言非常有趣，我花了一些时间了解 Crystal 并发现一些有用的东西，并在我学习的时候记录下来。

#### 常见问题

**你是谁？**

I'm [**Serdar Dogruyol**](https://github.com/sdogruyol), and I've been a Rubyist for years now. I'm the creator of [Kemal](http://kemalcr.com/), curator of [Crystal Weekly](http://www.crystalweekly.com/) and a [prolific Open Source contributor](https://github.com/sdogruyol).

I love new programming languages, and while I've been using Ruby for the past few years, I've coded in Java, PHP, Crystal, Elixir and a host of others. I also love writing, and good documentation, which is hard to find. Crystal doesn't have a lot of that yet, so I'm pitching in!

**为什么是 Crystal？**

[The first section of the book discusses this](http://www.crystalforrubyists.com/book/book.html#why-crystal) and i've written [a blog post](http://serdardogruyol.com/why-crystal) dedicated to this, but basically, Crystal is good at everything Ruby is bad at...plus as a Rubyist you already know Crystal.

**我能得到什么？**

Basically, you can [read the whole thing online for free](http://www.crystalforrubyists.com/book/index.html)

**我必须了解 Ruby 吗？**

Really, I love alliteration: the only thing the 'for Rubyists' really means is that I assume you don't know about types, pointers, concurrency, or similar things. That's okay, you've never had to think about them before! I explain this stuff in extra depth. If you program in another dynamically typed language, you'll be just fine. If you program in another typed language, you'll be more than fine.
